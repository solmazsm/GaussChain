**Gaussian Attack Detection in Incentive-Token-Based Federated Learning**

This repository contains the implementation for detecting Gaussian attacks in incentive-token-based federated learning systems. The code includes both the attack model and the blockchain-based auditing mechanism to ensure transparency and robustness in federated environments.

## Contents

- **Attack Simulation**: Implementation of the Gaussian attack, where colluding clients inject controlled noise to manipulate token-based rewards.  
- **Detection Mechanism**: Blockchain-based auditing protocol leveraging Merkle trees and peer verification for traceability.  
- **Experiments & Evaluation**: Scripts for running federated training with various datasets and aggregation strategies.  
- **Datasets**: Preprocessed versions of MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10, and SVHN.  
- **Reproducibility Guide**: Instructions to replicate all experiments from the paper.
